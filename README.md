### Gamification & Progress
- **XP & Leveling** — Earn XP per scenario, level up from Recruit → Elite Hacker
- **12 Achievements** — First Blood, Speed Demon, Perfect Analyst, Red Master, and more
- **User Dashboard** — Track level, XP progress, completed scenarios, and badges
- **Team Scoreboard** — Create/join teams, compete on a ranked leaderboard

### Learning Tools
- **🧠 Luca (Knowledge Base)** — 20+ cybersecurity terms with definitions, examples, and category filters
- **❓ Interactive Tutorial** — Guided 6-step walkthrough for new users
- **📰 Real-World Case Studies** — After each scenario, see how the attack maps to a real-world incident
- **💡 Hint System** — Get tool hints without revealing the full command

### Terminal Features
- **Realistic CLI** — Simulated terminal with prompts, colored output, and step validation
- **Basic Linux Commands** — `ls`, `pwd`, `whoami`, `id`, `ifconfig`, `cat`, `cd`, `clear`, `history`, `uname`, `date`
- **Keyword-Only Help** — `help` shows tool names + hints, encouraging students to construct commands themselves
- **Command Logging** — All terminal activity is logged and viewable via `history`
- **Detect Mode Commands** — `grep`, `timeline`, `filter`, `analyze`, `count`, `noise`, `logs`

### Visualization
- **Attack Chain** — Step-by-step progress bar showing current position in the attack
- **Network Topology** — Animated SVG diagram with pulse rings, glow effects, directional edges, and emoji node icons per scenario
- **🌙/☀️ Theme Toggle** — Dark (cyber) and light mode with full UI adaptation

### Security
- **Randomized Log Noise** — Benign logs mixed into Detect Mode for realistic analysis
- **No Real Exploitation** — All attacks are simulated; no actual systems are compromised
- **Local Storage** — All data stays in a local SQLite database
